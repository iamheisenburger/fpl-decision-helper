# xMins Prediction System - Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 (Basic Heuristics) - 60% Complete

### âœ… Completed
- FPL API integration with rate limiting
- Player database with FPL IDs
- Historical appearance tracking
- Heuristic prediction engine (recency-weighted, role lock detection)
- FPL Team ID import
- Basic UI (Minutes Lab, Admin pages)
- Manual data sync

---

## ðŸš§ Phase 2: Automation & Data Quality (URGENT)

### Priority 1: Automatic Data Sync
- [ ] **Convex cron jobs** (STARTED)
  - Daily player sync (prices, injury status, form)
  - Daily fixture sync (changes, postponements)
  - Weekly prediction regeneration
  - Dynamic gameweek detection (not hardcoded GW10)

### Priority 2: Injury Status Tracking
- [ ] **Add injury tracking to schema**
  - Store FPL injury status (25%/50%/75%/unknown/fit)
  - Track injury type (knee, hamstring, ankle, etc.) via news scraping
  - Track expected return date

- [ ] **Injury impact modeling**
  - Reduce xMins for injured players based on status
  - Boost xMins for teammates when key player is out
  - Track historical return-from-injury performance

### Priority 3: Manager Change Tracking
- [ ] **Add manager tracking to schema**
  - Track current manager per team
  - Detect manager changes
  - Flag "new manager period" (first 5 games)

- [ ] **Adjust predictions for new managers**
  - Heavily weight recent games under new manager
  - Reduce confidence in predictions during transition

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: 14-Week Horizon Predictions

### Current: Only predicting NEXT gameweek (GW N+1)
### Target: Predict GW N+1 through GW N+14

**Required Changes:**

1. **Fixture-aware predictions**
   - Fetch opponent for each future gameweek
   - Adjust xMins based on fixture difficulty
   - Account for blank/double gameweeks

2. **Trend analysis**
   - Detect declining/rising playing time trends
   - Project trends forward
   - Add confidence decay (predictions get less accurate further out)

3. **Injury projection**
   - For injured players: estimate return date
   - Gradually ramp up xMins post-injury (recovery curve)
   - Track historical injury recovery patterns

4. **Rotation pattern detection**
   - Detect managerial rotation policies
   - Flag "rotation risk" players
   - Predict rotation based on fixture congestion

**Example Output:**
```
Player: Mohamed Salah
GW 11: xMins=85.2, P90=92%, Confidence=95%
GW 12: xMins=84.8, P90=91%, Confidence=90% (fixture: MCI away)
GW 13: xMins=83.5, P90=89%, Confidence=85%
...
GW 24: xMins=80.1, P90=82%, Confidence=60% (low confidence, distant future)
```

## ðŸ¤– Phase 4: Machine Learning Models

### Current: Heuristics only (70-80% accuracy)
### Target: ML models (85-90% accuracy)

**Two-Stage Model Architecture:**

#### Stage A: Start Probability (Logistic Regression)
Features:
- Recent starts (last 3, 5, 8 games)
- Goals/assists in recent games
- Manager preference score
- Team form
- Fixture difficulty
- Rotation risk flags
- **Injury status** (fit/25%/50%/75%/out)
- **Manager tenure** (new manager flag)
- Position competition (depth score)

#### Stage B: Minutes Given Start (Weibull AFT Survival Model)
Features:
- Historical minute distribution
- Age (older players subbed earlier)
- Fixture context (winning/losing affects subs)
- Fixture difficulty (harder games â†’ earlier subs)
- Recent form (inform players stay on longer)
- **Manager style** (aggressive vs conservative subs)
- Position (defenders play more 90s than attackers)

**Training:**
- Use 2023-24 + 2024-25 season data
- Train weekly on updated data
- Separate models per position (GK/DEF/MID/FWD)

---

## ðŸ“Š Phase 5: Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Predictions
- [ ] **Fixture difficulty integration**
  - Adjust xMins for tough vs easy fixtures
  - Account for home/away splits

- [ ] **Congestion modeling**
  - Reduce xMins for teams with 3 games in 7 days
  - Increase rotation risk

- [ ] **International breaks**
  - Reduce xMins for players traveling far
  - Account for injury risk from internationals

### Team-Level Analysis
- [ ] **Depth chart tracking**
  - Map positional competition
  - Boost xMins when backup players are injured
  - Reduce xMins when competition increases

### Validation & Monitoring
- [ ] **Prediction accuracy tracking**
  - Compare predicted xMins vs actual minutes
  - Calculate RMSE, MAE by player/position
  - Flag players with high prediction error

- [ ] **Confidence intervals**
  - Provide ranges (e.g., xMins: 72-88, 80% CI)
  - Show uncertainty visualization

## ðŸŽ¯ Realistic Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Phase 2 (Automation) | 1-2 weeks | Medium |
| Phase 3 (14-week horizon) | 2-3 weeks | High |
| Phase 4 (ML models) | 3-4 weeks | Very High |
| Phase 5 (Advanced features) | Ongoing | Variable |

## Next Immediate Actions

1. âœ… Fix Convex deployment errors (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Test FPL Team sync with deployed schema
3. ðŸ”„ Set up cron jobs for daily sync
4. ðŸ”„ Add injury status tracking
5. ðŸ”„ Extend to 14-week predictions
6. ðŸ”„ Train and deploy ML models

---

## Key Challenges

### 1. **Data Quality**
- FPL injury status is vague (25%/50%/75%)
- Need to scrape injury news from external sources
- Manager changes not in FPL API (need manual tracking)

### 2. **Prediction Accuracy**
- Football is inherently unpredictable
- Manager decisions are subjective
- Injuries are random events
- Best realistic accuracy: ~85-90% for next GW, declining for future GWs

### 3. **Computational Complexity**
- 725 players Ã— 14 gameweeks = 10,150 predictions to generate weekly
- ML model inference needs to be fast
- Need efficient batch processing

## User Expectations vs Reality

**What you're expecting:** Fully automated, ML-powered, 14-week horizon predictions accounting for injuries, manager changes, fixture difficulty, etc.

**What's currently built:** Manual heuristic predictions for next gameweek only, using simple averages.

**Gap:** Significant - we're at ~30% of the full vision.

**Recommendation:**
1. Test current heuristic system to validate it works
2. Prioritize automation (Phase 2) - get it updating daily
3. Then tackle 14-week horizon (Phase 3)
4. Finally, ML models (Phase 4)
