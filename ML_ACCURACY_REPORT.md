# ML Accuracy Improvement Report
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Session Goal:** Push ML accuracy toward NORTH_STAR 90-95% target at ±20-25 min

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** 74.67% at ±25 min (improved from ~70% baseline)
**Target:** 90-95% at ±20-25 min (NORTH_STAR stretch goal)
**Gap:** ~15-20 percentage points to target

**Key Achievement:** Fixed critical data bottleneck - ICT/influence/bonus data was defaulted to 0, now flowing from FPL API.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL: Real Quality Data (Was Defaulting to 0)
**Problem:** The model was blind to player quality because ICT/influence/bonus features were all 0.

**Solution:** Updated `ingest_historical_data.py` to fetch 11 new columns:
- `ict_index`, `influence`, `creativity`, `threat`
- `bonus`, `bps` (bonus points system)
- `expected_goals`, `expected_assists`, `expected_goal_involvements`
- `team_h_score`, `team_a_score` (for scoreline features)

**Impact:** Quality features now contributing to predictions (see feature importance below).

---

### 2. Enhanced Feature Engineering
**Added 6 new features (47 total, was 41):**

#### Quality Features (2 new):
- `creativity_last_5` - Chance creation metric
- `threat_last_5` - Goal threat metric

#### Opponent Difficulty (3 new):
- `opponent_strength_norm` - Team strength (normalized 0-1)
- `is_top6_opponent` - Binary flag for strong opponents
- Fetches live team strength from FPL API

#### Substitution Patterns (2 new):
- `early_sub_rate_last_5` - % of starts ending 60-75 min (rotation signal)
- `full_90_rate_last_5` - % of starts playing 85+ min (nailed signal)

---

### 3. Improved Evaluation Metrics
**Old:** Only evaluated at ±15 min threshold
**New:** Evaluates at ±20, ±25, ±30 min thresholds
**Reason:** NORTH_STAR target is 90-95% at ±20-25 min, not ±15 min

---

### 4. Better Outlier Detection
**Detected 1,112 outlier events (5.4% of data):**
- 38 red cards
- 1,077 early injury substitutions (<20 min after starting)

**Why this matters:** These events shouldn't influence "normal" xMins predictions. A player subbed at 15 min due to injury shouldn't lower their predicted minutes for next week.

---

## Current Performance

### Stage 1: Start Probability (XGBoost Classifier)
- **Test Accuracy:** 89.03%
- **ROC AUC:** 0.957
- **Precision:** 83.70%
- **Recall:** 90.28%
- **Status:** ✅ Excellent

**Top Features:**
1. `prev_gw_started` (79%) - Did they start last week?
2. `is_early_injury_sub` (3%) - Outlier flag
3. `prev_gw_minutes` (2%) - Last week's minutes
4. `minutes_last_7_days` (2%) - Physical load
5. `start_rate_last_3` (2%) - Recent form

---

### Stage 2: Minutes Prediction (XGBoost Regressor)
- **Test MAE:** 10.70 minutes
- **Test RMSE:** 15.39 minutes
- **Test R²:** 0.725
- **Status:** ✅ Good

**Top Features:**
1. `is_early_injury_sub` (68%) ⚠️ **TOO HIGH - might be overfitting**
2. `prev_gw_minutes` (5%)
3. `full_90_rate_last_5` (4%)
4. `prev_gw_started` (2%)
5. `team_rotation_rate` (1%)

---

### Combined: xMins = P(start) × E[minutes | start]
- **MAE:** 17.10 minutes
- **±20 min:** 71.37% ❌ (target: 90-95%)
- **±25 min:** 74.67% ❌ (target: 90-95%)
- **±30 min:** 77.71% ❌ (target: 90-95%)

**Status:** 🟡 Progress made, but below target

---

## Analysis: Why Are We Below Target?

### Issue 1: Combined Accuracy Metric May Be Flawed
**Current calculation:**
```python
actual_minutes = y_start_test * 80  # Approximation: 80 min if started
```

**Problem:** This assumes all starters play 80 minutes, which is inaccurate. Some play 90, some 60, some get injured at 15 min.

**Solution:** Need to reconstruct actual minutes from the full dataset using test indices.

---

### Issue 2: `is_early_injury_sub` Dominating Minutes Model (68%)
This feature is detecting outliers perfectly but might be causing the model to overfit on outlier events rather than learning normal rotation patterns.

**Potential fixes:**
- Remove outlier events from training data entirely
- Reduce feature importance weight
- Use separate models for normal vs outlier scenarios

---

### Issue 3: New Quality Features Not Dominating Yet
ICT, influence, creativity, threat are now present but not in top 10 features. This suggests:
- Either they're correlated with existing features (prev_gw_minutes, form)
- Or the model needs more training data to learn their importance
- Or feature scaling might help

---

### Issue 4: Limited Training Data (20,742 appearances)
With 47 features and 20,742 samples, we have ~440 samples per feature. This is sufficient for gradient boosting but not ideal.

**Options:**
- Use more seasons (but NORTH_STAR says quality > quantity)
- Feature selection (remove less important features)
- Regularization (prevent overfitting)

---

## Roadmap to 90-95% Accuracy

### Immediate (Next Session):

#### 1. Fix Combined Accuracy Metric
- Reconstruct actual minutes from test indices
- Use proper train/test split tracking
- Validate that 74.67% is the true accuracy

#### 2. Handle Outliers Properly
**Option A:** Exclude outliers from training entirely
```python
df_clean = df[df['is_outlier_event'] == 0]
```

**Option B:** Train separate models
- Model 1: Normal scenarios (no outliers)
- Model 2: Outlier recovery (injury returns, red cards)

**Option C:** Reduce outlier feature importance
- Set max_depth lower to prevent overfitting on outliers

#### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [4, 6, 8],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'min_child_weight': [1, 3, 5],
    'subsample': [0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
}
```

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.

---

### Short-Term (This Week):

#### 4. Try LightGBM/CatBoost Ensemble
Now that they're installed, train multiple models and ensemble:

```python
xgb_pred = xgb_model.predict(X)
lgb_pred = lgb_model.predict(X)
cat_pred = cat_model.predict(X)

# Weighted average based on validation performance
final_pred = 0.4*xgb_pred + 0.3*lgb_pred + 0.3*cat_pred
```

#### 5. SHAP Analysis for Feature Importance
```python
import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
```

This will show which features are truly driving predictions and which are noise.

#### 6. Stratified Cross-Validation
Current CV is 5-fold but not stratified by important factors:
- Stratify by position (GK, DEF, MID, FWD)
- Stratify by team (top 6 vs bottom 14)
- Ensure balanced representation

---

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks):

#### 7. Advanced Feature Engineering

**Manager-Specific Features:**
- Pep rotation rate (Man City): 45%
- Arteta rotation rate (Arsenal): 25%
- Howe rotation rate (Newcastle): 20%
- Learn these from historical data per manager

**European Fixture Congestion:**
- UCL/Europa game in last 3 days → rotation risk ↑
- Track fixture density: games in last 7 days

**Squad Depth Intelligence:**
- Count viable alternatives per position
- If 3+ options for striker → rotation risk ↑
- If only 1 option → nailed on

**Substitution Timing Patterns:**
- Subbed at 60-70 min in last 3 games → rotation candidate
- Full 90 in last 5 games → nailed on

#### 8. Calibration Tuning
Ensure predicted probabilities match reality:
- If model says "70% chance to start", player should start 70% of time
- Use Platt scaling or isotonic regression
- Optimize Brier score, not just accuracy

---

### Long-Term (Future):

#### 9. Neural Network Ensemble
Add a deep learning model to capture complex interactions:
```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

#### 10. Survival Analysis (Weibull AFT)
Model minutes as time-to-event:
- Output full probability distribution, not point estimate
- "70% chance of 80-90 min, 20% chance of 60-70, 10% chance of 0-30"

#### 11. Automated Weekly Retraining
- Retrain every Monday after gameweek completes
- A/B test new model vs production
- Only deploy if accuracy ↑
