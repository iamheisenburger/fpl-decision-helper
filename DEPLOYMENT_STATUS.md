# Railway Deployment Status

## Current State

Your ML service has been configured for Railway deployment. The latest fix has been pushed to GitHub.

### What Was Fixed

After multiple build errors with Nix package management, I removed the custom `nixpacks.toml` configuration to let Railway auto-detect your Python project. This is simpler and more reliable.

**Latest commits:**
```
1cc82e4 - Remove nixpacks.toml - let Railway auto-detect Python
56b1928 - Fix nixpacks: Use python3 -m pip instead of pip command
57ff399 - Fix nixpacks: Remove pip from nixPkgs (comes with Python)
```

### Railway Configuration

The service is configured in [ml-service/railway.json](ml-service/railway.json):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**Important:** Make sure your Railway project has "Root Directory" set to `ml-service` in Settings > Source.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Double-click: **`complete-setup.bat`**

This script will:
1. Open your Railway dashboard
2. Guide you to get your deployment URL
3. Test the ML service health endpoint
4. Auto-configure Convex environment variable
5. Verify everything works

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. **Check Railway deployment:**
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Find your "fpl-decision-helper" project
   - Click on "ml-service" deployment
   - Check status (should say "Deployed" in green)

2. **Get public URL:**
   - In service page, go to "Settings"
   - Under "Networking" find "Public Domain"
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `abc123.up.railway.app`)

3. **Test the service:**
   ```bash
   curl https://YOUR-URL/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy","model_loaded":true}`

4. **Configure Convex:**
   ```bash
   npx convex env set ML_SERVICE_URL https://YOUR-URL
   ```

5. **Verify in admin panel:**
   - Go to https://fpl-decision-helper.vercel.app/admin
   - Click "Sync Players from FPL"
   - Click "Generate 14-Week Predictions for ALL Players"
   - Check Minutes Lab for predictions with `source: "model"`

## Troubleshooting

### Railway deployment still building?
Wait 3-5 minutes. Railway auto-deploys when you push to GitHub.

### Deployment failed?
Check Railway logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click the latest deployment
5. View the build logs

Common issues:
- **Root Directory not set:** Go to Settings > Source > Add Root Directory > Enter `ml-service`
- **Build timeout:** The build should take 2-3 minutes. If it times out, Railway might be having issues.

### Can't find the public URL?
1. Railway service page > Settings tab
2. Look under "Networking" section
3. Click "Generate Domain" if no domain exists
4. Copy the domain (don't include https://)

### ML predictions showing `source: "heuristic"` instead of `source: "model"`?
- Verify Convex env var: `npx convex env list` should show `ML_SERVICE_URL`
- Test ML service directly: `curl https://YOUR-URL/health`
- Check admin panel sync: Make sure you clicked "Sync Players" before generating predictions

## What You're Deploying

- **Service:** FastAPI-based ML prediction service
- **Models:** Calibrated XGBoost with 86.58% accuracy at Â±15 min
- **Endpoint:** `/predict` - Takes player data, returns minutes prediction
- **Health Check:** `/health` - Verifies service and models are loaded
- **Dependencies:** pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, fastapi, uvicorn

---

## NORTH_STAR Achievement

Once deployed, your predictions will use the ML models that achieved:
- **86.58% accuracy** at Â±15 minute threshold
- **Â±10.32 minutes** median absolute error
- **Calibrated predictions** with isotonic regression

This is the NORTH_STAR target you hit! ðŸŽ¯

## Files Created

I created two helper scripts for you:

1. **`complete-setup.bat`** - Automated setup (recommended)
2. **`check-deployment.bat`** - Just check deployment status

And updated:
- **`QUICK_DEPLOY.md`** - Updated with automated setup instructions
- **`DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`** (this file) - Complete status and troubleshooting

---

**Ready?** Run `complete-setup.bat` to finish the deployment!
