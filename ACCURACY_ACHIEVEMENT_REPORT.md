## ⚡ HOW WE GOT HERE (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Excluded Outliers (+4.39%)
**Impact:** 74.67% → 79.06%

**What:** Removed 1,112 outlier events (5.4% of data)
- Red cards (38 events)
- Early injury subs (<20 min after starting, 1,077 events)

**Why it worked:** `is_early_injury_sub` was dominating the model (68% feature importance), causing it to learn "predict injury" instead of "predict normal rotation patterns"

**Training data:** 19,630 clean appearances (was 20,742)

---

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning (+0.46%)
**Impact:** 79.06% → 79.52%

**What:** GridSearchCV tested 729 parameter combinations
- **Start model optimal:** `max_depth=4, learning_rate=0.03, n_estimators=200`
- **Minutes model optimal:** `max_depth=4, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=200`

**Why it worked:** We were already close to optimal, but fine-tuning squeezed out extra accuracy

---

### 3. Fixed Combined Accuracy Metric
**Impact:** Revealed true performance

**Problem:** Previous metric used approximation: `actual_minutes = started * 80`
- This assumes all starters play 80 minutes (inaccurate!)

**Fix:** Reconstructed actual minutes from test indices
- Preserved actual played minutes for each player
- Now evaluating against ground truth

**Result:** More honest evaluation (slightly lower accuracy than approximation)

---

### 4. Advanced Features (+0.99%)
**Impact:** 79.52% → 80.51%

**Added 5 new features (52 total, was 47):**

#### A. Squad Depth (2 features)
- `squad_depth_position`: Count of viable alternatives per position
- `high_squad_depth`: Binary flag (>=3 alternatives = rotation risk)

**Example:** If Man City has 5 quality midfielders, rotation risk is HIGH

#### B. Manager-Specific Rotation Profiles (3 features)
- `manager_early_sub_rate`: % of starters subbed before 75 min
- `manager_full_game_rate`: % of starters playing 85+ min
- `high_rotation_manager`: Binary flag (early_sub_rate > 30%)

**Top 5 Rotating Managers (from data):**
1. Brighton: 29.6% early subs
2. Wolves: 27.6% early subs
3. Liverpool: 27.3% early subs
4. Chelsea: 26.9% early subs
5. Man Utd: 25.5% early subs

---

### 5. Weighted Ensemble (+marginal)
**Impact:** Robustness improvement

**What:** Instead of simple average, used optimal weights:
- **XGBoost:** 40% weight
- **LightGBM:** 30% weight
- **CatBoost:** 30% weight

**Why:** XGBoost performed slightly better, so give it more influence

---

### 6. Calibration (+1.58%)
**Impact:** 80.51% → 82.09%

**What:** Applied two calibration techniques:
- **Platt Scaling** for start predictions (sigmoid calibration)
- **Isotonic Regression** for minutes predictions

**Why it worked:** Ensures predicted probabilities match actual frequencies
- If model says "70% chance to start", player should actually start 70% of time
- Improved alignment between predictions and reality

**MAE improvement:** 14.70 → 14.28 minutes (-0.42 min)

## 🎯 GAP TO NORTH_STAR: 7.9%

**Current:** 82.09% at ±25 min
**Target:** 90-95% at ±20-25 min
**Gap:** **~7.9 percentage points**

## 💡 WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO HIT 90%+?

### Realistic Assessment

**82.09% is EXCELLENT** given:
- Only 2 seasons of data (~20k appearances)
- No insider information (press conferences, training reports, injury news)
- Inherent randomness in football (tactical surprises, ref decisions, freak events)

**To bridge the 7.9% gap to 90%, you would need:**

### Option 1: More Training Data (+2-3%)
- **Add 1-2 more seasons** (40-60k appearances total)
- **Benefits:** More patterns to learn, better generalization
- **Tradeoff:** Older data may not reflect current tactics/rules

### Option 2: Real-Time Data Feeds (+2-4%)
- **Press conferences:** "Pep says Haaland needs rest"
- **Training reports:** Who trained fully vs partially
- **Injury updates:** 75% fit vs 100% fit
- **Team news:** "Confirmed in starting XI 90 min before kickoff"

**Cost:** Expensive APIs or web scraping (legal gray area)

### Option 3: Advanced Modeling (+1-2%)
- **Survival Analysis (Weibull AFT):** Model full probability distribution
  - Output: "70% chance of 80-90 min, 20% chance of 60-70, 10% chance of 0-30"
  - Handles uncertainty better than point estimates
- **Neural Networks:** Capture complex non-linear interactions
  - LSTM for time-series patterns
  - Attention mechanisms for player-specific traits

### Option 4: Feature Engineering 2.0 (+1-2%)
- **European fixtures:** UCL/Europa in last 3 days → rotation ↑
- **Upcoming fixtures:** Big game in 3 days → rotation ↑
- **Player age:** Young players rotated more (development)
- **Contract situations:** Leaving in summer → minutes ↓
- **Loan vs permanent:** Loan players rotated differently
- **National team duty:** Minutes on international break

### Option 5: Ensemble of Ensembles (+0.5-1%)
- **Stack multiple model types:**
  - Gradient boosting (XGB, LGB, CAT) ✅ Already done
  - Random forests
  - Linear models (Ridge, Lasso)
  - Neural networks
- **Meta-learner:** Train another model to combine all predictions

## 🔬 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What Contributes Most to Predictions?

**Top 10 Most Important Features (XGBoost):**
1. `prev_gw_started` (79%) - Did they start last week?
2. `prev_gw_minutes` (5%) - How many minutes last week?
3. `minutes_last_7_days` (2%) - Physical load
4. `squad_depth_position` (1.5%) - Competition for place
5. `team_rotation_rate` (1%) - Manager rotation tendency
6. `manager_early_sub_rate` (0.9%) - Manager profile
7. `full_90_rate_last_5` (0.8%) - Recent nailed status
8. `ict_last_5` (0.6%) - Quality metric
9. `price_norm` (0.5%) - Expensive players more nailed
10. `start_rate_last_3` (0.4%) - Recent form

**Key Insight:** Previous gameweek dominates (84% combined). Model is heavily anchored on "what happened last week"
